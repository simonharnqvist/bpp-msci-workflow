# bpp-msci-workflow
A Snakemake workflow for the MSCi framework in BP&amp;P

## Description ##
BP&P is a software for demographic analyses enabling studies of (among many other things) introgression. While highly useful, it can be challening to use. The hope is that this workflow will simplify the use of BP&P for introgression analyses.

It should be emphasised that this project is completely unaffiliated with BP&P and its development team. 

## Prerequisites ##
This workflow requires Snakemake as well as mamba. Please see their respective websites to install them.
